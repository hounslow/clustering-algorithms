# Clustering Algorithms

## About
This project was done during my time studying in the CS 340: Machine Learning course run by Dr. Mike Gelbart and co. Much of the base code can be attributed to him and his team. Algorithms related to clustering such as k-Medians, DBSCAN plus vector quantization were done by Matthew Hounslow.

## Contents

In this repo you will find working implementations of k-means, k-medians, variations of least squares, as well as quantization of images. All code is written in Python 3.6. Sklearn's clustering were also used here.

## Dependencies

- numpy
- Sklearn
- matplotlib


## Running the project

In order to run the project, use `python3 main.py -q <topic-number>` where <topic-number> represents the section in main.py. Each section number pertains to a different technique in this case. More comments will be added to these files down the line to give greater clarity.
